    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thinly sliced linguiça</li>
        <li>Sliced ham</li>
        <li>Juicy steak</li>
        <li>Fluffy white bread</li>
        <li>Spicy tomato and beer sauce</li>
        <li>Melted cheese</li>
        <li>Crispy fries (for serving)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>      
    <ol>
        <li>Start by grilling the thinly sliced linguiça and ham until they are lightly browned and have a nice smoky flavor.</li>
    
        <li>In a separate pan, cook the juicy steak to your preferred level of doneness. Season it with salt and pepper for added flavor.</li>
    
        <li>While the meats are cooking, prepare the spicy tomato and beer sauce. Combine tomatoes, beer, and your choice of spices in a saucepan. Simmer until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld together.</li>
    
        <li>Assemble the Francesinha by layering the grilled linguiça, ham, and cooked steak between slices of fluffy white bread.</li>
    
        <li>Pour the prepared spicy tomato and beer sauce generously over the sandwich, ensuring it soaks into the layers of meat.</li>
    
        <li>Add a generous layer of your favorite melted cheese on top of the sandwich. You can use a broiler or oven to melt the cheese until it's golden and bubbly.</li>
    
        <li>Carefully remove the Francesinha from the heat source, making sure the cheese is perfectly melted.</li>
    
        <li>Serve the Francesinha hot, accompanied by a side of crispy fries to complement the richness of the sandwich.</li>
